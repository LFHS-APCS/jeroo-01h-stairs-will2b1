Inside of Jeroo.java, write the method ```climbStairs()``` that will pickup all the flowers on the staircase as shown in the pictures below.

IMPORTANT:  You can only use:
* ```hop()```
* ```pick()```
* ```plant()```
* ```turn(LEFT)```
* ```turn(RIGHT)```

You should be calling helper method(s) written inside of ```climbStairs```.  Do NOT put all the code inside of ```climbStairs```.

Be sure to comment your helper methods using /** */
